#### How to run Application:

1. It is required to use [CodeBlocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/ "CodeBlocks") IDE with [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/ "MinGW") compiler.

2. Download [CMake](https://cmake.org/ "CMake") building tool to build required libraries to suit your operative system. It is recomended to build libraries instead of using pre-build one.

3. Download [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download "GLFW") library, build it using CMake and link library within [CodeBlocks IDE](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/ "CodeBlocks IDE").

4. Download [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/ "GLAD") library, build it using CMake and link library within [CodeBlocks IDE](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/ "CodeBlocks IDE").

5. Download [Assimp](https://assimp.org/ "Assimp") library, build it using CMake and link library within [CodeBlocks IDE](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/ "CodeBlocks IDE").
